# css-battle

In this project, I will solve all the challenges that we will find on
https://cssbattle.dev. These challenges help to improve your knowledge of css in
terms of code optimization and final results. You can also try and let me know
your solutions. I will try to keep the code clear with as little character as
possible.

1. Simply Square

```
<body bgcolor="#b5e0ba"></body>
<style>
  body {
    margin: 0;
    box-shadow: inset -200px -100px #5d3a3a;
  }
</style>

```

# Optimized

```

<body bgcolor=#62374e><div><style>body{padding:42px}div{width:50px;height:50px;background:#fdc57b;box-shadow:250px 0 #fdc57b,250px 150px #fdc57b,0 150px #fdc57b}

```
