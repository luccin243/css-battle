# css-battle

In this project, I will solve all the challenges that we will find on
https://cssbattle.dev. These challenges help to improve your knowledge of css in
terms of code optimization and final results. You can also try and let me know
your solutions. I will try to keep the code clear with as little character as
possible.

```
<body bgcolor="#b5e0ba"></body>
<style>
  body {
    margin: 0;
    box-shadow: inset -200px -100px #5d3a3a;
  }
</style>

```
